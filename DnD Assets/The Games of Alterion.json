					"\"Ye think yerself a great hero because ye've killed great monsters with that axe? Ye may have great strength, but if all ye can do is kill, then ye'll never bring peace to these lands. We'll see if ye can quell violence or if ye'll only feed the echo of Death its next meal.\"",

					"Death Echoes are the restless shades of those who perished in frenzied bloodshed, their forms now mere whispers of black and gray: a silhouette or shadow pierced only by eyes aglow with crimson, amber, or sapphire malice. Reborn in places of shadow where battle and death once swelled, they hunger for the chaos of mortal strife, their spectral blades slashing at anything nearby with desperate fervor. So long as they are feeding on the fumes of violence, each \u201cdeath\u201d fuels their curse, knitting their essence back together, stronger and more relentless, mocking the finality of the grave while embodying its inevitable embrace for their prey. Though they will attack mortals and undead alike, they crave mortal strife and death above all, always seeking combat with the living where they can be found.",
					"Yet their unnatural existence is fragile, tethered to violence. Deny them the clash of steel or the spill of blood, and they unravel, fading into the void with a mournful wail. In desperation, they may turn their blades on each other in vain, a pitiful echo of their former selves clinging to the fray before inevitably returning to the pits from which they came."
